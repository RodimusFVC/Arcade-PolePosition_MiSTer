//============================================================================
//  namco_06xx.sv — Namco 06XX bus arbiter (Z80 <-> up to 4 Namco 5xxx MCUs)
//
//  Ground truth: MAME src/devices/machine/namco06.cpp (namco_06xx_device).
//  Interfaces the Z80 (via PolePosition_CPU's n06_* ports, 0x9000 data /
//  0x9100 ctrl, both mirror 0x0EFF) to chip0=51xx, chip1=53xx, chip2=52xx
//  (Phase-5, unbuilt), chip3=54xx (Phase-4, unbuilt). Only chip0/chip1 are
//  wired to real wrappers in this increment; chip2/chip3 read as 0xFF
//  (matches MAME's devcb_read8 default) and have no write sink.
//
//  Control register (ctrl_w, MAME-bit-exact):
//    [3:0] = chip-select mask (bit0=51xx bit1=53xx bit2=52xx bit3=54xx)
//    [4]   = R/!W direction (1 = read mode, 0 = write mode)
//    [7:5] = num_shifts; enable/clock-divider. (ctrl[7:5]==0) => disabled.
//
//  data_r (read mode): AND-reduce of the read() outputs of all SELECTED
//    chips (0xFF for unselected/absent chips) — pure combinational, NOT
//    gated by the chipsel/NMI timer below (matches namco06.cpp data_r()).
//  data_w (write mode): broadcasts the written byte to all SELECTED chips'
//    write() ports — also NOT gated by the timer (matches data_w()/write_sync()).
//  The chipsel/NMI timer below only drives each MCU's own /IRQ input (so its
//  OWN firmware knows to service the mailbox) and the Z80's NMI (so the Z80's
//  boot-time polling loop knows a transfer is ready) — see nmi_generate().
//
//  #1 HW-TUNE POINT — TWO deferred/synchronized behaviors from MAME are
//  reproduced here as a ONE-clk_sys-cycle register delay (ctrl_apply /
//  data_apply below), NOT MAME's full "next scheduler quantum":
//    (a) ctrl_w is deferred (machine().scheduler().synchronize) — the Z80
//        boot code writes ctrl=0x10 then polls ~4 instructions later,
//        relying on the write NOT being visible instantly.
//    (b) data_w is deferred the same way.
//  If HW bring-up shows the Z80 racing/stalling on the 06xx handshake
//  (self-test stuck, "0" screen not advancing), THIS is the first thing to
//  re-time — e.g. widen the delay to a full Z80 CE tick, or align to a
//  falling-CE-edge boundary the way MAME aligns to "the next falling clock
//  edge" in ctrl_w_sync(). The nmi_generate phase-restart-on-ctrl-write
//  (div_cnt/timer_state reset in the ctrl_apply branch below) is also a
//  simplification of MAME's attotime-based "delay to the next falling clock
//  edge" re-arm — a deterministic restart-to-phase-0 rather than a true
//  phase-continuous realignment.
//
//  Base tick: MAME's 06xx device clock = MASTER_CLOCK/8/64 = 24.576MHz/512 =
//  48kHz. Our fabric clk_sys = 49.152MHz = 2x MASTER_CLOCK, so clk_sys/1024
//  is the equivalent 48kHz tick (base_ce below). nmi_generate is invoked
//  every (divisor/2) base ticks, divisor=2^ctrl[7:5] (1..128, only 2..128
//  reachable while enabled since ctrl[7:5]==0 means disabled).
